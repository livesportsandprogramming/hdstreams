# hdstreams
Tired of searching for Football streams of major/most-watched matches? I have also faced similar issues, but right now, here I am...streaming for y'all guys.
I stream most of the major football matches with no interruptions, no lags, HD quality, and with English Commentary too.
So, visit my website and enjoy.
Website Link - https://livesportsandprogramming.github.io/live-football-hd/
A few things to note here:
1. Live Streaming Link will only be available 5 minutes before the Kick off time.
2. Refresh the browser page 5 minutes before the kickoff time to get the stream link.
3. After clicking on stream link, wait for 5-10 seconds for the stream to auto adjust the quality to max available quality.
4. If the sound is not audible, just adjust it from the video controls available in that player.
5. If the stream does not start auto-playing, click on the play button present in the video controls.
6. Even after doing all the above, if the stream still does not work or does not show up then just email me using the link available in the website at multiple places like footer or above the video player etc...That is the most fastest way to reach me.
Thanks and hope you guys enjoy my website....
